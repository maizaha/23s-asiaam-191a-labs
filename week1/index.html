            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> Hi! I'm a third-year undergraduate at UCLA double majoring in International Development Studies 
                and Cognitive Science (one of my greatest sources of anxiety is having to explain what my two 
                majors are about, so please don't ask). As you can tell, my interests are kind of all over the place, but 
                I'm very passionate about thinking about development critically and in relation to colonialism, imperialism, 
                and white supremacy. I also really love all types of art, and I enjoy creating illustrations in my (virtually nonexistent) 
                free time (Procreate is the best app ever, change my mind ðŸ˜©).
                <br>
                <br>
                To give you an idea of what my course schedule looks like, here are some favorite UCLA classes:
                <ol>
                    <li> GLB ST 145: Rethinking Global Capitalism </li>
                    <li> HIST 12C: History of Anti-Colonial Thought </li>
                    <li> CLUSTER 27: Global Islam </li>
                    <li> CS 180: Algorithms and Complexity (Pain&#8482; class, but interesting) </li>
                </ol>
                As a critical digital map maker, I hope to apply my creative and technical 
                skills to projects that empower communities, while holding myself accountable to the power dynamics intrinsic to
                conducting research and manipulating data. Above all, I hope to learn from the communities I'm serving 
                and work with intention in order to avoid the pitfalls of extractivism that are so common in research. Excited to 
                code empathically, compassionately, and ethically! </p>
            <h3> Talk to me about... </h3>

                <li> Illustration & <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgyJ0Uj2Xg0&t=">animation</a>! In an alternate universe I'd work at Pixar... </li>
                <li> All the "ism's": colonialism, imperialism, capitalism, etc. Yes, I'm a massive nerd! </li>
                <li> Fictional characters you are currently brainrotting over (I am currently in shambles over the <a href="https://www.leighbardugo.com/book/six-of-crows/">Six of Crows</a> duology &#129402&#128420) </li>
            </ul>
